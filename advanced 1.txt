magic functions are also known as a Dunder method - they are method that have a two underscore before and after the name of the mothod.
for example:
            the __add__ method - (can add objects)  
            the __sub__ method - (can sub objects)
            the__mul__ method  - (can multiply object)
            the__pow__ method - (can raises a object squared)

the object will be printed in way that a human can be read.

the compare that will be checked is if the value of the objects thar we want to compare are the same. 

4. 
operator overloading means that we can extended meaning even beyond the predefined.
         in example if we want to add tow objects the compiler throw an error because he don't know how to add two objects
            so we need to define a method and this process called operator overloading.
               and for cases like this Python gives us the magic methods like the __add__ method that know immediately we write + to add two object.
