Question 1:
Behind every site or app there are a few servers with different roles and its make a lot of servers.
    Docker is a software that allow us develop environment and run apps on containers. 
        its gives us separation between our apps and the they infrastructure, so we can spread easier and faster (we don't need to  install on the computer nothing but docker engine.).

Question 2:
Docker img is a pattern to create and define a container. its include the require instructions to build a container. 
    this pattern is read only!
        to create img we have three options: 
            1: by registry - remote repository of img that we can pull from there images. 
            2: by tar file - load from file that already exists. 
            3: by dockerfile - file that we can build from it docker image. this file contain instructions how to build a container.

Question 3:
its like a mini machine that run over the operating system of the server. we can connect him like every else server.
    its based on the img file and create when we run the img. 

Question 4:
img is the pattern and the container is the program its self.

Question 5:
Environment variables are constants available to any programs running in a Docker container. 
    they are usually used to say how the program behaves.

Question 6:
the volumes role is to connect folder in our local machine into a folder in the container.
    Its purpose is to provide information that the container uses and to display the information created in the container.
