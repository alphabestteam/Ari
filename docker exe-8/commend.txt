Question 1:
to run the tomcat image first of all we need to pull it - "docker pull tomcat:latest and then run it - docker run -p 8080:8080 tomcat".

Question 2:
but now we got en error 404 so i found the solution in google and it said to run those commends after we run the first commend:
    1. "docker run -d --name mytomcat -p 8080:8080 tomcat:latest"
    2. "docker exec -it mytomcat /bin/bash"
    3. "mv webapps webapps2"
    4. "mv webapps.dist/ webapps"

Question 3:
to build our selfs image after we create dockerfile - "docker build -t custom-tomcat".
and to run it - "docker run -p 8080:8080 custom-tomcat".
