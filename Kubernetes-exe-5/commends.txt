I use in this commend for the front "kubectl scale deployment frontend-deployment --replicas=3"
    and this commend for the back "kubectl scale deployment backend-deployment --replicas=3"


The purpose of scaling is to adjust the number of pods running the application. 
    I might want to scale mostly when my application experiences increased traffic, scaling allows to distribute the load across multiple pods.
        It also can halp me tho improve the availability or for resource utilization.
