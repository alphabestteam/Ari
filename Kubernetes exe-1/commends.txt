Question 1: 
to create work environment we have two ways: 
                                            the first one: create a namespace file dot yaml.
                                            the second one: by the CLI using the commend - "kubectl apply -f first-namespace.yaml"
                        
Question 2:
to upload the two parts I created two files backend and frontend dot yaml. 
    I pull the images from the github for the back and the front and then I apply both of them.
        and by "kubectl get pods -n first-namespace" we can see the status.
