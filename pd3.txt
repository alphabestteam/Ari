Exceptions happens when you hava a incorrect result for exemple if you try to divide some number by 0, 
           the Exceptions will print us a massage and the last line of the massege it tell us what kind of error it was.
               Python alow us to raise a Exceptions in our code if some condition occurs.
                      to raise Exceptions in your code use you can use it like this:
                                                                                    x = 5
                                                                                    if x > 3
                                                                                    raise Exception('x should not exceed 3')
and also we have the try and exception, the try keyword check a block of code to see if there any errors. 
the exception keyword let you handle the errors.
and also we have the else keyword who  let you run the code when no error found. 
and last we got the finally keyword who let yu run the code but with no conaction to the try and exception block.

list Comprehension alow us to create a new list based on a existing list.
     for exemple if i had a list with names and i want to create another list with all the names that contain the letter "a", instead of using for loop we can use list Comprehension that way:
                                                                                                                                                                                             names = ["Ari", "David", "Hen", "Daniel"]
                                                                                                                                                                                             newlist = [x for x in names if "a" in x]


2.2 
we don't have to use them, instead of it we can use for loop on the old list.
