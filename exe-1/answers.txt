Part One:
Question 1:
first we have the version of the Docker we use.

the service contain all the containers, we have two containers: 
mongo: first the name of the image.
        the container name.
        the environment variables.
        the ports we want to use.
        the volume we want to use.

mongo-express: first the name of the image.
                the container name.
                the environment variables.

and then we have the volumes: the data and the configurations are persisted using named volumes.

Question 2:
the problem is that we don't have a port in the mango-express container.

Question 3:
we added the port 8081:8081 in the mongo-express container. 

Question 4:
by the commend - "docker-compose down"


Part Two:
i created a env file and write there the environment variables and then in the yml file i did like this - ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_ADMINUSERNAME: ${ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_ADMINUSERNAME}.
    AND NOW IF WE WANT TO CHANGE SOMETHING WE CAN CHANGE IT IN THE ENV FILE AND IT WILL BE CHANGE EVERYWHERE (By mistake it clicked on caps lock and I realised it too late ;( )
