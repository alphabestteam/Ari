the open() commend open for us file that we give his path. 
    after the open() commend we can write the read method, read() let us the permission to read and only read from the file (we can read only line with readline(). or read only few letters with read(5)).
          the write() method let us the permission to write text over the exist text. if it don't find the request file he create one.
              the a commend is like write() but it add text in the end of the text and not write over it. and like write() it also create file if he don't find it.
                  the b commend is stand for a binary file (t stand for text file).
