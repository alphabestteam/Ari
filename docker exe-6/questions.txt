Question 1:
Layers can speed up the process by a few things: 
    a: every layer take care for a different task.  
    b: layers can gives us replacement of components without affect on the system.
    c: layers save they date and allow take care of independent maintenance.
    d: they make the control and testing much easier. 

Question 2:
the first option is better because when we use the && is combine a few commands to one RUN and its promise one layer - make the image efficient ans smaller then a few layers.

Question 3:
to check the num of the layers we can use - docker history - it will print us a table with all the layers.
